                <p>I grew up in York, Pennsylvania for most of my childhood.  After graduating high school I attended the University of Pittsburgh where
                    I studied Philosophy and Psychology.  While studying in college I began working part-time in the hospitality industry primarily as a server 
                    in fine dining establishments.  After graduating with my Bachelor's I continued to work in the hospitality industry while looking for a job
                    to start buidling my career off of.

                    me and provides me with a sense of fulfillment.
